=================

The Container Console is an administration screen used to configure and
output system data from Container system. The Container Console is a set of screens
packaged within the Container application. The Container Console can be accessed via the url:

https://hostname.domain.com/container-ws/administration/index.html

The **Container Console requires updating to ensure that the latest libraries are used** as well as protect against latest attack vectors. It was initially designed to be used by Systems Administrator users only. Later on, some role-based access has been added to the functionality.
